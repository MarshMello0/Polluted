# Polluted

Polluted was meant to be an open world survival game where you're based in a world which has just been abandon by the human race due to its high levels of pollution. 

This is my level 3 final year final major project, where we had to create a game based on the theme "Forgotten". The way this linked to the work was that the player was forgotten on the planet when everyone left.

My original proposal for the game idea can be found on my [WordPress here](https://benlevel3year2.wordpress.com/proposal-2/).

## Whats in the files?
These files are the whole Unity project including the Blender files which I created the assets in.

The releases are the final build of the game which you would give to players to play.
